# CTData
This repository contains the Unity project for creating 3D meshes of CT Scan data for CSCI 535.

It is important to note that `data.txt`, which the project uses to load the function data, is not included as it is too large a file. This file can be obtained by using the `readdata.py` script to convert from the `.nrrd` file.
