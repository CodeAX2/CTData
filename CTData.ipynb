    "# Viewing CT Scan Data In Unity\n",
    "### By Jacob Hofer\n",
    "\n",
    "In the medical field, it can be useful to obtain a 3D mesh representation of data from MRI or CT Scans. Obtaining this mesh can be done in a variety of ways, but the algorithm we will look at is marching cubes.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Mesh Creation Pipeline\n",
    "The general pipeline of generating a 3D mesh is shown below:\n",
    "\n",
    "![PipelineImage](./NotebookImages/Pipeline.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "In the pipeline, data is converted from `.nrrd` to a simpler `.txt` format to be loaded into Unity. Within Unity, marching cubes is ran on various function values, denoted `value1`, `value2`, and `value3` in the diagram, to obtain multiple meshes of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Converting the .nrrd File\n",
    "We begin with an `.nrrd` file. In our case, the file [CTA-cardio.nrrd](./CTA-cardio.nrrd) will be used.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to work with our Unity scripts, we first need to convert the file to a custom `.txt` format. This will be done via Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "As usual, we begin with importing our libraries. The only library we import is `nrrd`, installed with: \n",
    "\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "pip install pynrrd\n",
    "```\n"
